# Getting Started

The code demonstration is providing the insights of how the bootstrap method works in the field of statistics. Bootstrapping is a simple alternative method for statistical inference based on re-sampling with replacement. Read more about it [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bootstrapping_(statistics))

## Installation
Use the package manager [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) to install numpy and matplotlib.

```bash
pip install numpy
pip install matplotlib
```

Execute the notebook [Bootstrapping - Code Demonstration.ipynb](https://github.com/Lawrence-LUOoo/Bootstrapping-Code-Demonstration/blob/main/Bootstrapping%20-%20Code%20Demonstration.ipynb) cell-by-cell to understand how each part of bootstrapping works.

## Analysis steps
1. simulate population distribution
2. take a random sample from the population
3. bootstrap for 10,000 times
4. analysis and interpretation
5. plot the probability distribution and confidence interval
